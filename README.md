I learned to navigate using the git bash app and to use severall commnads (init, add, create a branch, push, etc.).

Challenges you faced while completing the tasks:

Find the commands that I needed to use that are not mentioned in the training document

New things you learned from the hands-on experience:

Work with git and github from scrach... until now I worked with existing repositories.

Any feedback or questions you might have about the training.

I don't have any questions but I do have one thing to mention as feedback.
I would mention in the steps from the homework that the steps 8 and 9 are to be executed on the initial local repository "git_homework". Otherwise it can be understood that these steps are to be applied on the cloned repository from step 7.
Other than this it's easy to learn adn a great experience.
